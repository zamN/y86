index.page -> you enter all your command and shit
  -- once stuff is entered ajax call is made to interpret.page
    -- passes the command as a param
  -- after interpret is done it will then refresh the registers.page which will have all of the updated information on it.

interpret.page -> sends the command to external java program which will update the internal variables and such.
  -- modifies registers.page to represent internal structures.

registers.page -> will have a whole listing of all registers~~
