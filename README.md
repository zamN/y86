Y86 Interpreter
=================
This is the project that [Zach Fogg](https://github.com/zachfogg), 2 other team members, and I created for the UMD CMSC Hackathon.

It is a Y86 Assembler interpreter which allows the user to enter Y86 commands and will show them the results of each command. 

How To Run
---------------
```
$ cd y86
$ play run
```

Prerequisites
--------------
Play Framework 2.0 Must be installed.  
Java JDK 1.6+
